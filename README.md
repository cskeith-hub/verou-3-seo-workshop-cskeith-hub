## Learning objectives

SEO, search engine optimisation, is a typical buzzword.
Developers know what it is, but aren't always sure how to implement it.
That's no surprise, as it's not an exact science: SEO is about making sure search engines find your site for the right searches.
Google never fully releases their matching algorithm, but they do release guidelines - but these can change frequently.
Most SEO best practices are based on those and findings from analysing website traffic after website changes.

Today, you'll learn:
- The basics of SEO
- How to use tools to analyse your site

## The Mission

### An introduction

As we just learned, a lot of the specific guidelines change frequently ([meta keywords](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag), anyone?).
There's some general rules though, that are (almost) always useful, so let's look into those:

#### Aaah! A spider!

Spiders or crawlers are little tools search engines use to quickly analyse a site.
They want to get a good idea about the kind of content it has, and they want it fast.
It's also possible to tell Google that a site has been updated, so they'll crawl it (again) sooner.

#### An image says more than a 1000 words - but how does it talk to crawlers?

Sites relying on a lot of stunning images can be really beautiful!
However, crawlers can analyse text way faster than images.
Make sure your site does have enough relevant text combined with images to cater for both humans and crawlers.

#### Multitasking is a lie

When you're Googling a very specific tech problem, what would you prefer?
- The general docs of the language
- A stackoverflow question, specifically on your error

I prefer the latter. This applies to SEO too: if a page has a clear focus, it's probably going to be more relevant than one page covering 10 different topics at once.

#### Beep. Beep. Robot talk in (your city)!

Every visited a page that was promoting (cleaning services) in (your city)?
But then, it would repeat it over and over again, until the point where it was written for a crawler and not for a human anymore?

Those sites are trying to cheat the search engine algorithm.
It was a technique that used to work (otherwise, we'd not know these sites), but Google is more and more aware these days and actively punishing bad or exaggerated website copy. 

Write your copy with users in mind, and you should be good. After all, the better a search engines helps users, the market share it will get!
So we're all aligned on a user-centric approach.

### ðŸŒ± Must have features

Read about the SEO possibilities of the [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) tool.
Use it to improve the SEO of a site of the following list (you can copy-paste the html/css of one page):
- [https://www.lingscars.com/](https://www.lingscars.com/)
- [http://www.niceberg.be/](http://www.niceberg.be/)
- A site of your choosing

### ðŸŒ¼ Nice to have features (doable)

Do a keyword analysis of the company owning the site: what is important for them?
How can they use their site to attract more customers?
Provide content for an extra page with strong SEO potential.
